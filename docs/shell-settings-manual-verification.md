# Shell settings — manual verification

The Shell settings workspace makes bar geometry, appearance,
modules, wallpaper, and system behavior live-configurable, persisted to
`~/.local/state/quickshell/shell-settings.json`. Automated coverage:
`tests/run` — the Node suite (store merge/clamp rules, schema/property
agreement, qmldir completeness, IPC single-declaration, typography lint) plus
`tests/qml-lint`, a qmllint sweep over every shell QML file — and
`tests/verify-system` (settings IPC liveness). Everything pointer-driven below
is manual.

## Opening and closing

- [ ] `qs ipc call settings toggle` opens the centered window; again closes it.
- [ ] On an output with at least 900×680 logical pixels available, the card
      opens at 900×680 with the labeled sidebar. Below 860px available width,
      the same navigation becomes an icon rail with tooltips and 42px targets.
- [ ] `qs ipc call settings open modules` lands on the Modules page.
- [ ] Gear in the Control Panel footer opens it (and closes the popout).
- [ ] Right-click anywhere on the bar slab opens it; left-clicks on modules
      still open their popouts.
- [ ] `Super+,` opens Settings directly without making the menubar focusable.
- [ ] Esc closes; clicking the scrim closes; opening the launcher closes it
      (focus grab handover).
- [ ] Opening settings while a popout is open closes the popout first.

## Launcher keyboard path

- [ ] Restart Quickshell, then immediately press `Super+Space` and type. The
      first character appears in the search field; no click or second key is
      needed to establish focus.
- [ ] With the empty query and its first result selected (for example,
      1Password), press Enter immediately after `Super+Space`. It launches
      even while the card is still completing its short entrance animation.
- [ ] Down/Up, Tab, Home/End, Alt+1…8, Enter, and Esc all work without moving
      focus out of the search field. Closing restores focus to the prior app.
- [ ] Reopen repeatedly: results appear together without a row-by-row delay,
      and the first open after shell startup feels the same as later opens.

## Persistence

- [ ] First slider drag creates the JSON; `watch -n1 stat -c %y` on it shows
      at most ~2 writes/s during a continuous drag.
- [ ] Editing the JSON externally applies live (no restart); junk values are
      clamped or reverted to defaults on the next save.
- [ ] A schema-5 pristine floating bar migrates to Hug; a customized height,
      radius, or gap remains Floating; an old non-floating bar becomes Attached.
      Module order and centered Clock/Weather remain unchanged.
- [ ] Deleting the file live restores defaults; restart keeps them.
- [ ] Reset controls reset exactly their group and show an eight-second
      `… reset · Undo` footer. Undo restores the snapshot; a new reset replaces
      it; any manual edit clears it. A forced save failure exposes Retry.

## Wallpaper page

- [ ] Grid lists the configured wallpaper folder; clicking a thumb swaps the
      wallpaper live and moves the accent ring + ✓.
- [ ] "Shuffle now" picks a different wallpaper each press.
- [ ] Rotate 15 min / 1 hour / Daily arms the timer ("Off" disarms).
- [ ] "Choose folder" stays inside the settings surface. Valid folders,
      including paths with spaces, preserve the current basename or choose the
      first alphabetic supported image. Empty/unreadable folders change nothing.
- [ ] "Open" opens the selected directory in the file manager. Large folders
      scroll smoothly without constructing every thumbnail at once.
- [ ] Narrow the content below 520px: the gallery switches to one column and
      folder path/actions stack without clipping or covering each other.

## Appearance page

- [ ] Dark / Light changes the shell palette; Glass effect switches the bar,
      popouts, launcher, notifications, OSD, shortcuts, tooltips,
      and floating menus between blurred translucent and opaque surfaces.
      The full-screen shortcut scrim stays translucent in both modes.
- [ ] Glass effect applies without closing Settings or remapping/flickering the
      bar. Toggle it twice quickly, then reload Hyprland and restart Quickshell;
      the final persisted state wins each time.
- [ ] Wallpaper palette shows surface/primary/error swatches and generation
      status. Switching Dark / Light selects the cached variant without a new
      Matugen process; changing wallpaper regenerates once after the debounce.
      Accent colors follow the wallpaper while the selected menubar background
      remains unchanged.
- [ ] Change wallpapers rapidly: no stale palette flashes. Temporarily hide
      `matugen` or feed malformed output: the selector remains Wallpaper,
      the fallback error appears, and the stored fixed palette renders.
- [ ] Bar Background offers Shell Default, macOS, Black, Graphite, Slate, White,
      and Custom in both Wallpaper and Fixed modes. Only the Accent area is
      absent in Wallpaper mode, leaves Tab/Orca traversal immediately, and
      returns with its values unchanged after switching back to Fixed.
- [ ] A Black menubar changes its text/icons to light tones; White changes
      them to dark tones. Accent, warning, error, workspace, weather, and T3
      marks remain legible, with no change to popover colors.
- [ ] Custom reveals Hue, Saturation, and Lightness sliders. Their tracks and
      the real bar update live, the chosen HSL survives a preset round-trip,
      and the Bar Background reset restores the adaptive Shell Default.
- [ ] Font rows render their own family; picking one reflows the bar and
      popovers instantly. Test every menu font: names and samples stay in
      separate bounded lanes with no overlap.
- [ ] Fixed accent swatches and hue recolor the whole shell in Fixed mode and
      are not focusable or exposed in Wallpaper mode.
- [ ] "Apply Layered Hug" enables Hug, Wallpaper, Glass, and dot workspaces in
      one undoable action without changing module order, height, radius, or gap.

## Bar page

- [ ] Position Bottom moves the bar; every popout opens above it with its
      directional motion mirrored, content upright; tooltips flip
      above modules; toasts hug the top edge; Esc/hover-switching still work.
- [ ] Style picker renders Hug as full-width with 16px concave corners,
      Floating as the existing detached rounded slab, and Attached full-width
      and square. Top/Bottom mirrors Hug's corners without mirroring content.
- [ ] Height slider resizes the real bar live; the miniature tracks it; the
      labeled Height presets row snaps to 38/46/54 without detaching its pills.
- [ ] Edge gap and corner radius are shown only for Floating and leave keyboard
      and accessibility traversal immediately when hidden. Their stored values
      survive a round trip through Hug and Attached.
- [ ] Changing Height or Corner radius dirties/reset-enables Bar only;
      Appearance remains clean. Reset Bar owns and restores both values.
- [ ] Auto-hide: bar slides away after ~1.6 s without hover; hovering the
      screen edge reveals it; it stays out while a popout or the settings
      window is open; clicks pass through the vacated strip.
- [ ] Reserve space off lets tiled windows extend under the bar
      (exclusive zone released; Hyprland re-tiles once per toggle).
- [ ] Every connected output keeps its own bar while focus moves between
      monitors; hotplug creates/removes only that output's bar.
- [ ] Opening a module or Shell settings from either bar shows exactly one
      panel, attached to the bar that was clicked.

## Modules page

- [ ] Mini preview mirrors order and enablement (disabled = dashed chip),
      including all four independent status widgets.
- [ ] The cog appears only on configurable modules (Workspaces, Media, Clock,
      Weather, T3 Code, Model usage, Volume, Battery, Notifications) and turns
      accent when that module's options or detail policy left their defaults.
- [ ] The cog opens the module's settings sub-page in place (list hidden, back
      button focused); Back or Esc returns to the list with the row refocused;
      a second Esc closes the window as before.
- [ ] Detail policy (Auto / Prefer detail / Always compact) is picked on the
      sub-page; Prefer detail compacts only after Auto modules.
- [ ] Per-module options apply live: clock seconds/date format, battery and
      volume percentage toggles and thresholds, media title format and width,
      usage provider toggles and warn/critical thresholds, T3 label and pulse,
      workspaces min slots / hide empty / dots, bell badge dot/count/off.
- [ ] Weather place/latitude/longitude edits commit on Enter or focus loss and
      refetch; Esc inside a text field restores the value without closing
      anything; junk input snaps back to the stored value.
- [ ] Reset page on Modules resets layout, detail policies, and all module
      options (with Undo); per-row undo chips reset one option.
- [ ] Toggles apply to the bar instantly; auto-rules keep working (Media
      only while playing, Bluetooth only when connected, Battery on
      laptops).
- [ ] Drag a row: source dims, proxy follows the pointer, accent caret
      marks the gap (rows never shift); drop reorders within and across
      columns, including end-of-column; Esc during a drag cancels it (a
      second Esc closes the window).
- [ ] Disabling a module whose popout is open closes that popout.
- [ ] T3 Code and Model usage can each be toggled, reordered, and moved across
      columns; Claude, Codex, and Kimi remain grouped under Model usage.
- [ ] Disabling T3 Code or Model usage while its popout is open closes only
      that popout; the other module still opens normally.
- [ ] Volume, Network, Bluetooth, and Battery can be reordered within or
      across columns; each dedicated popout follows its widget. The fixed
      Fedora Control Panel button remains at the right edge.
- [ ] In a narrow/stacked settings panel, pointer and keyboard drops use the
      correct column-relative index, edge dragging scrolls, and focus returns
      to the dropped row.
- [ ] At 640px of Modules content width, LEFT/CENTER/RIGHT render as three
      columns; below it they stack. In the preview, each lane clips its own
      chips and never paints into another lane. Optional tags disappear before
      a full module name is shortened.

## Notifications page

- [ ] Preview updates live for position, duration, density, icons, body lines,
      and timeout progress. “Timeout progress” and its description never
      collide with the switch or reset lane.
- [ ] Quiet Hours Off/Nights hides custom time sliders and removes them from
      Tab/Orca traversal; Custom reveals both, preserving the stored range.
- [ ] “Send test notification” and its current suppression explanation sit on
      one line when they fit and stack cleanly on a narrow panel.

## System page

- [ ] 12 h clock reformats the bar clock and both live captions.
- [ ] °F refetches weather in Fahrenheit (bar chip + popover + forecast).
- [ ] Warmth drag with Night light on retints smoothly (single hyprsunset
      restart per pause, not per step).
- [ ] OSD placement Top shows volume/brightness pills top-center, clearing
      the bar; Bottom returns them; slide-in direction matches the edge.
- [ ] Poll every 1 min shortens the countdown; the usage popover and the
      caption agree.
- [ ] The full config path elides in its own lane; Open and Reset all remain
      reachable and stack below it before any collision.

## Regression sweep

- [ ] Volume, Network, Bluetooth, and Battery are distinct transparent-resting
      buttons. Each opens its own Audio, Network, Bluetooth, or Battery view;
      with one open, crossing another button switches the panel in place.
- [ ] The rightmost Fedora logo opens the Control Panel. Its SESSION row shows
      five equal controls in order: Lock, Suspend, Log out, Restart, and red
      Shut down. Each closes the panel before running its established action.
- [ ] The launcher's Power action and `qs ipc call session power` open/toggle
      the Control Panel on the focused output; `qs ipc call session lock`
      remains a direct lock action.
- [ ] All popouts open/close/hover-switch as before at default settings;
      Calendar → Weather and other adjacent-module switches work without a
      second click; with Settings open, hovering a module also switches.
- [ ] Click Claude once, then hover Codex and Kimi; the open Usage view changes
      immediately while its panel stays anchored. From another open popout,
      hovering a provider opens Usage after the normal hover delay and selects
      the provider under the pointer.
- [ ] Resize/hotplug from a wide output down to 800 logical px: detail compacts
      Media → Weather → Clock date → T3 → Volume → Battery → Usage, every
      enabled module remains, clusters retain an 8px gutter, and the center
      shifts only after all eligible detail is compact.
- [ ] Fine-grained touchpad scrolling over Volume changes it once per
      accumulated wheel step, not once per raw event.
- [ ] Workspace cells keep a 22px width and full 30px target. Moving right
      sends the lozenge's right edge in 120ms and left edge in 300ms; moving
      left reverses those assignments. Hide-empty/model/settings changes snap,
      while urgency, numbered mode, tooltips, and accessible actions persist.
- [ ] Tab/arrow traversal, automatic focus scrolling, roles/states/actions,
      and Orca announcements work for navigation, custom controls, resets,
      drag/drop, module cogs and their sub-pages, and save errors.
- [ ] Capture comparison screenshots for default Hug/Wallpaper, Floating/Fixed,
      and a narrow panel. In each, check header title/description, preset/test
      action copy, font samples, notification labels, config/folder paths,
      module names, and preview chips for clipping or overlap.
- [ ] `journalctl --user -u quickshell.service` free of QML errors and
      binding loops after exercising every page.
- [ ] `tests/verify-system` passes.
