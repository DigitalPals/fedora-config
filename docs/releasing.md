# Publishing CybexOS releases

Public updates are built from semantic-version Git tags by
`.github/workflows/release.yml`. The workflow will not publish unless the full
source contract and a twice-converged generic Fedora VM both pass.

## One-time repository setup

1. Enable immutable releases in the GitHub repository settings.
2. Keep Actions permitted to create attestations and write release contents;
   the workflow grants only those job-level permissions.
3. Protect the default branch and require the source and generic-VM checks.

The updater refuses a release when GitHub reports `immutable: false`, even if
the archive checksum is otherwise correct.

## Release checklist

1. Review `release-manifest.json`, `VERSION`, the Fedora release,
   configuration schema, minimum updater version, and all dependency pins.
2. Run `./tests/run` and `./tests/fedora-vm-convergence` locally when practical.
   The source gate includes an N to N+1 ownership test that advances vendor
   runtime while requiring every user customization sentinel to remain
   byte-identical.
   The user-widget fixture also loads a fixed API 1 package outside the
   runtime through simulated replacement and rollback. Retain supported API
   adapters when changing the shell; see [the widget contract](architecture/user-widgets.md).
3. Commit the intended source and create a signed semantic-version tag, such
   as `git tag -s v1.0.0 -m 'CybexOS 1.0.0'`.
4. Push the commit and tag. A version containing a hyphen, such as
   `v1.1.0-beta.1`, is published as a prerelease for the beta channel.
5. Wait for the workflow to build, attest, upload, publish, and confirm the
   immutable release before announcing it.
6. On a clean supported machine, run `cybex update --check --json`,
   apply the release, and run `cybex verify --system`.

Do not edit an existing release. Immutability makes correction explicit: fix
forward, increment the version, and publish a new tag. If rollout must stop,
remove the bad release from channel discovery and publish a corrected release;
users whose system apply failed remain on their previous active source and
retain their prior configuration automatically.

## What the workflow publishes

The release contains a versioned source archive and `SHA256SUMS`. Its checksum
entry uses the asset basename, so it can be verified directly after both files
are downloaded into one directory. The archive
is reconstructed from the tagged Git tree, its `VERSION` and manifest version
are set to the tag, its installer is checked, and Ansible syntax is validated.
GitHub attestation plus immutable-release verification form the updater trust
boundary; files copied from an arbitrary branch or mutable URL are not
accepted as updates.
