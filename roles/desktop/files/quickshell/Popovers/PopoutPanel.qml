// The contract the popout host has with whatever it loads.
//
// These three things used to be duck-typed at the host: it asked
// `item.availableWidth !== undefined` before sizing, `item.drawBackground
// !== undefined` before suppressing a doubled background, and
// `item.handleEscape && item.handleEscape()` before dismissing. None of that
// could be checked, and a panel that misspelled one simply never got the
// behaviour. Declaring them here lets IslandPopout hold its loaded item as a
// PopoutPanel and read them as properties.
//
// A FocusScope rather than an Item because Settings/SettingsView.qml is one
// and needs to stay one; every popover surface inherits this through
// Popovers/Surface.qml. Panels that want the keyboard say `focus: true`
// themselves — setting it here would have both of the host's two content
// slots claiming focus at once, including the one that is off screen.
