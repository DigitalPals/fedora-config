// floating a fixed gap below the bar, centred on whatever opened it.
//
// It springs up out of its trigger — scaled down and offset toward the bar,
// with the transform origin pinned to the trigger's own edge — while the
// content eases in a beat earlier, so the copy is legible before the shape has
// finished settling. Switching panels keeps the same card and morphs its
// geometry, which is what makes hovering along the bar read as one surface
// following the pointer rather than a series of windows.
//
// Two content slots stay alive so a switch can cross-fade rather than blink.
// The slots are keyed by the view's source, not the opening name: names that
// share one view (the drawer tabs, the Day sheet's two triggers) keep the
// front slot and swap in place, so those switches never fade at all.
