# Quickshell icon assets

The shell chooses icons by semantic role:

- Generic actions and status use `Common/Sym.qml` and Material Symbols
  Rounded.
- Product identities use `Common/BrandIcon.qml` and the allow-list in
  `Common/BrandIcons.qml`.
- Installed applications use the desktop icon theme through
  `Quickshell.iconPath()`; tray items retain the status-notifier icon supplied
  by their application.
- Small animated primitives may be drawn in QML when an icon-font shape does
  not animate or align correctly.

Do not add an identity SVG directly to a view. Add its canonical asset here,
record its provenance below, register it in `BrandIcons`, and render it through
`BrandIcon`. Small interactive marks also get a `-white.svg` sibling made by
changing paint only. `BrandIcon` cross-fades those two source files so hover
does not rebuild the mark from an alpha mask and change its apparent weight.
T3's canonical mark is already white and is reused for both states.

## Provenance

The source revisions are pinned so each path can be audited independently of
later upstream changes. Local changes are limited to adding a shell palette
fill, removing redundant SVG metadata, or cropping a mark out of its app-icon
background.

| Assets | Vector source | Revision | Local treatment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `claude.svg`, `github.svg`, `kimi.svg`, `tailscale.svg`, `whatsapp.svg`, `youtube.svg` and their `-white.svg` siblings | [Simple Icons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons) | `4a79bb55697c85b8bc9f3caa22be747e0277ad4f` | Upstream paths with product/shell paint; hover siblings change only that paint. |
| `openai.svg`, `openai-white.svg` | [Tabler Icons: `brand-openai`](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons/blob/5a0fe38e97784d94279ce4eb1bf85f9a91bf027e/icons/outline/brand-openai.svg) | `5a0fe38e97784d94279ce4eb1bf85f9a91bf027e` | Upstream strokes with Codex/white paint. Stroke width and geometry are unchanged. |
| `slack.svg`, `slack-white.svg` | [Tabler Icons: `brand-slack`](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons/blob/5a0fe38e97784d94279ce4eb1bf85f9a91bf027e/icons/outline/brand-slack.svg) | `5a0fe38e97784d94279ce4eb1bf85f9a91bf027e` | Upstream strokes with Slack red/white paint. Stroke width and geometry are unchanged. |
| `t3.svg` | [T3 Code production logo](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/blob/a3a8cbd60539b4af4de8f96c892dbd07a2b6c041/assets/prod/logo.svg) | `a3a8cbd60539b4af4de8f96c892dbd07a2b6c041` | Cropped to the wordmark; background removed. |
| `fedora.svg`, `fedora-white.svg` | [Fedora Design: `fedora_default-horizontal.svg`](https://gitlab.com/fedora/design/team/logos/fedora-project-logos/-/blob/e7ee4e88ac5b43a1acf2ab39157b63c80e8093f2/brand-book-assets/logo-svgs/fedora_default-horizontal.svg) | `e7ee4e88ac5b43a1acf2ab39157b63c80e8093f2` | Cropped to the official standalone Fedora mark; the hover sibling changes blue to white without changing its path. |
